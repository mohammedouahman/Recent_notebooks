    "**Data Warehouse** pulls in raw data from disparate sources. (could be production systems, logs, ...) Stores data in a clean, standardized form available for analysis. Generally a relational database that stores historic operational data from across the organization. Optimized to support complex multidimensional queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Information discovered must be previously unknown.\n",

    "**Association Rules** Objects that satisfy condition X are likely to satisfy condition Y. Great for Market Basket Analysis (Group similar items), cross selling, catalogue design, store layout, financial forecasting, likelihood of illness.\n",

    "In DBMS, hashing is a technique to directly search the location of desired data on the disk without using index structure. \n",
    "### Use Hashing When:\n",
    "- For a huge db, an index may not be fast enough\n",
    "- When you don't want an index (??)\n",

    "- Addresses in mem are sorted by the key.\n",
    "- Use for range retrieval od data\n",
    "- Slower than hash for freq updates (since the whole index must be reorganized\n",

    "- Ideal for retrieval of individual records\n",
    "- Fast updates for frequent update situations\n",
    "- Hash file must be constantly managed"
