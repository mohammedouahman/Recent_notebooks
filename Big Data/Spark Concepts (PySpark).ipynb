    "# How Spark Works\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Any Spark application creates __RDDs__ out of some input, runs lazy __transformations__ of that RDD to some other form, and performs __actions__ to collect or store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __SparkContext__\n",
    "is the foundation of the application. The entrygate of Spark functionality. It establishes a connection to the Spark Expecution environment. Used to create RDDs, accumulators and broadcast variables, access Spark services and run jobs.\n",
    "MASTER of the Spark application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gets current status of Spark application.\n",
    "- Cancels the job\n",
    "- Cancels the stage\n",
    "- runs job asynchronously/synchronously\n",
    "- accessing persistent RDD\n",
    "- Unpersisting RDDs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apache Spark Shell\n",
    "Application written in Scala that allows a Spark CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Job vs Tasks vs Stage\n",
    "A __task__ is a unit of work that is distributed across the partitions of data. Each partition has one task. A __job__ is a parallel computation consisiting of multiple tasks that are spawned by an action in Spark. A __Stage__ is a subset of tasks contained in a job. Each stage depends on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apache Spark Driver\n",
    "The main() function of the program runs in the __driver__, The driver runs the user code to create RDDs, perform Transformations and actions, and create SparkContext. The driver application splits the Spark application into tasks and schedules them among workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing a Spark Job\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using spark-submit, the user submits an application.\n",
    "- In spark-submit, we invoke the main() method that the user specifies. It also launches the driver program.\n",
    "- The driver program asks for the resources to the cluster manager that we need to launch executors.\n",
    "- The cluster manager launches executors on behalf of the driver program.\n",
    "- The driver process runs with the help of user application. Based on the actions and transformation on RDDs, the driver sends work to executors in the form of tasks.\n",
    "- The executors process the task and the result sends back to the driver through the cluster manager.\n",

    "Spark RDDs can be __cached__ and __manually partitioned__. Caching is useful when the dataset needs to be accessed several times. RDDs can __persist__ to indicate they will be reused in future operations. These persistent RDDs are stored in memory by default (but may spill to secondary if there isnt enough RAM) Nonpersistent will be thrown away after execution is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping RDDs in memory allows for faster iterative algorithms and interactive data mining. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve __fault-tolerance__, RDDs provide restructed form of shared memory.__Coarse-grained transformations__ means we can transform the whole dataset, but not an individual element of the dataset. Immutable in nature means changes to an RDD are permanent.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Actions__ returns the final result of RDD computations. It triggers execution using lineage graph to load the original RDD, carry out int. steps, and return final results to Driver Program or write to file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions are opertations that produce non-RDD values. (First(), Take(), Reduce(), Collect(), count())\n",

    "# Spark Documentation\n",
    "[link](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#using-the-shell)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Spark 2.0 the main programming interface of Spark was the RDD. After 2.0 the __RDD was improved by Dataset__, which is strongly typed with rich optimizations under the hood. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "__Dataset__ distributed collection of items. Can be called a DataFrame to be consistent with the Python/R data concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RDD Programming\n",
    "Paralleized collections are created with the *SparkContext* parallelize() method on an existing iterable in the driver program. This distributed dataset can be operated on in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of partitions for a parallelized dataset should be 2-4 per cpu in the cluster. this can be manually passed to the parallelize() method/\n",
    "\n",
    "### External datasets\n",
    "Data can be loaded from HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, S3 by modifying the URI passed when loading the dataset (local path ~ C://, hdfs://, s3a://\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Closures\n",
    "How do we understand the scope and life cycle of variables and methods that are being split up and distributed to multiple nodes in a cluster?\n",
    "\n",
    "SparkContext breaks RDD operations into tasks, each executed by an executor. Prior to execution Spark computes the task's __closure__ *the variables and methods that must be visible to the executor to perform the computation on the RDD.* Closure is serialized and sent to each executor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Accumulator__ used specifically to update a variable when execution is split across nodes in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Closures (loops and locally defined methods) should not be used to mutate a global state. Use an Accumulator if global aggregation is needed.__\n",
    "\n",
    "To print elements of an RDD use the *collect()* method. Which brings the entire RDD to the driver node (potential memory issues) One may also use *take(n)* to get the first n rows of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "__map(func)__ - Return a new RDD formed by passing each element of the source through function func.\n",
    "\n",
    "__filter(func)__ - Returns a new RDD by selecting elements of the source on which func returns true.\n",
    "\n",
    "__flatMap(func)__ - Similar to map, but each input item can be mapped to 0 or more output items. (func returns a sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "__sample(withReplacement, fraction, seed)__ - Sample a fraction of the data with or without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "__union(otherDataset)__ - returns a new dataset that contains the union of elements in source and argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "__intersection(otherDataset)__ - returns intersection of source and argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "__distinct(numPartitions)__ - returns a new dataset with the distinct elements of source\n",
    "\n",
    "__reducebyKey(func, numPartitions)__ - on a dataset of (K,V) pairs, returns a dataset of (K,U) pairs where values are aggregated using the reduce function func.\n",

    "__aggregatebyKey(zeroValue)(seqOp, CombOp)__ - on a dataset of (K,V) pairs, returns (K,U) pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "__sortByKey()__ - on a dataset (K, V) pairs where K implements ordering, returns the (K,V) dataset ordered by K\n",
    "\n",
    "__join(otherDataset)__ - called on datasets (K, V) and (K, W) returns a dataset (K, (V,W))\n",
    "\n",
    "__pipe(command)__ - pipe each partition of the RDD through a shell command\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "__reduce(func)__ - Aggregate the elements of the dataset using a function func which takes two arguments and returns one. Function should be commutative and associative. \n",
    "(Commutative ~ 5+8=8+5) (Associative ~ (1+2)+3 = 1+(2+3) )\n",
    "\n",
    "__collect()__ return all elements of the dataset as an array to the driver program. (CAREFUL)\n",

    "__foreach(func)__ - Run a function func on all elements of the dataset. (UNDERSTAND CLOSURES FIRST)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shuffle Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain operations trigger a Shuffle. Shuffle is a redistribution of data, so data is grouped differently across partitions. __Shuffle is complex and costly__ (involves copying data across executors and machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "ex. __reduceByKey()__ attempts to reduce all values with the same key are combined to a single tuple. For this to work, all values for the same key must be seen by the executor to produce a correct result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work, Spark needs to read from all partitions to find all the values for all keys, and then transfer identical keys to unique executors. This is the __shuffle__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "__Shuffle__ is expensive since it involves disk I/O, data setialization, and network I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shuffle is split into map and reduce tasks. Results from map tasks are kept in memory till they can't fit. Then these are sorted based on target partition and written to a single file. Reduce tasks read the relevant sorted blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shuffle operations use a boat load of heap memory since they store and organize records before or after transferring them. __reduceByKey__ and __aggregateByKey__ organize on the map side, __ByKey__ operationsorganize on the reduce side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shuffle generates many intermediate files on disk that are preserved until the corresponding RDDs are trashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## RDD Persistent\n",
    "\n",
    "*caching* a dataset in memory across operations is the main performance booster. When an RDD is persisted, each node stores any partition of it that it computes in memory and reuses them in other datasets. (If the node needs a partition for an op, it will take it and keep it)\n",
    "\n",
    "__persist()__ or __cache()__ can be set at different memory levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "to menually remove data you can use __RDD.unpersist()__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared Variables\n",
    "Spark provides two limited types of *shared variables* __broadvast variables__ and __accumulators__. During a task, a function and variables are passed to each execution node. The operations performed on these variables are not propagated back to the driver node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broadcast Variables\n",

    "Spark can be bottlenecked by any resource in the cluster: CPU, network bandwidth, or memory. Most often (if data fits in memory), its bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Serialization\n",
    "Serialization is important for distributed applications. Significantly reduces the memory footprint of objects to be transferred or objects not in use. Also makes theJava garbage collection faster, since multiple objects are combinged to a single serialized file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Tuning\n",
    "3 things: amount of memory used by objects, cost of accessing objects, and garbage collection overhead. \n",

    "Java objects have a large overhead. (a lot of metadata) This overhead can be reduced with serialization and smarter use of data structures.\n",

    "Memory usage is either execution or storage. __Execution memory__ is used for execution operations (shuffle, join, agg.) __Storage memory__ used for caching and propagating data across the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution and Storage share a unified region that adjusts to the amount of data cached by the app program.
