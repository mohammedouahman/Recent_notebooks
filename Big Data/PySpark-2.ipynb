    "### Python vs Scala\n",
    "When you’re working with the DataFrame API, there isn’t really much of a difference between Python and Scala, but you do need to be wary of User Defined Functions (UDFs), which are less efficient than its Scala equivalents. That’s why you should **favor built-in expressions if you’re working with Python**. When you’re working with Python, also make sure **not to pass your data between DataFrame and RDD unnecessarily**, as the serialization and deserialization of the data transfer is particularly expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "thon is a good choice when you’re doing smaller ad hoc experiments, while Scala is great when you’re working on bigger projects in production. Remember that when a language is **statically typed**, every variable name is bound both to a type and an object. Scala is statically typed, Python is dynamically typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDD, Dataset, and DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "**RDDs** have three main characteristics: they are compile-time type safe (they have a type!), they are lazy and they are based on the Scala collections API.\n",
    "- it’s easy to build inefficient transformation chains, they are slow with non-JVM languages such as Python, they can not be optimized by Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataFrames** are optimized: more intelligent decisions will be made when you’re transforming data and that also explains why they are faster than RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset** can take on two distinct characteristics: a strongly-typed API and an untyped API\n",
    "\n",
    "since Python has no compile-time type-safety, only the untyped DataFrame API is available. Or, in other words, Spark DataSets are statically typed, while Python is a dynamically typed programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use RDDs when you want to manipulate the data with functional programming constructs rather than domain specific expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Persist vs Broadcast Variables\n",
    "Instead of creating a copy of the variable for each machine, you use broadcast variables to send some immutable state once to each worker. **Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a cached read-only variable in every machine.** In short, you use these variables when you want a local copy of a variable\n",
